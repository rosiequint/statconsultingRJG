## Introduction 

The purpose of this document is to provide step-by-step instructions and code for analyzing the [Demographic and Healthy Surveys Model Data](https://www.dhsprogram.com/data/Download-Model-Datasets.cfm), which can then be extended to analyzing specific country DHS data. DHS data is collected using population-based survey and includes a wide range of variables providing information about population health, reproductive health, child health, and more for countries around the globe. In this example, we use the 'Individual Recode' data file and provide all code in R. 

## Research Objective

Throughout this demo, we explore the research question: **What is the impact of gender norms on health outcomes?** More specifically, we explore outcomes related to domestic violence and contraceptive use, which have direct impact on one's mental, physical, and sexual health. We use predictors related to gender roles and customs in the home, which are further explained in the *Describe Your Data* section. While this research question is one example of how to use DHS data, the methods and code we provided can be extended to other analyses. We present foundational steps for working with different types of variables, plotting data, and modeling relationships, which are important skills for many analyses. We hope this resource will be of use to those interested in answering their own questions using the DHS data.  

This resource is structured as follows.  

## Contents

### 1) Prepare Your Data

Learn how to read in data to your R environment and create a subset according to your analysis. 

### 2) Describe Your Data

Learn how to summarize and visualize your data. Learn how to use sampling weights and stratification to present your summaries. Learn how to create new variables from existing ones.  

### 3) Model Your Data  

Learn how to conduct epidemiologic analyses using linear and logistic regression and hypothesis testing.  


# 1) Prepare Your Data  

Begin by navigating to the [Demographic and Healthy Surveys Model Data](https://www.dhsprogram.com/data/Download-Model-Datasets.cfm) page and downloading the 'Individual Recode' data file shown below (ZZIR62FL.DTA). Save this file to your working directory.

Use the following code to read the data into your R environment:  

```{r}
#install.packages("haven")
library(haven)
dhs <- read_dta("ZZIR62FL.DTA")
```

Use the View command to open your data into a viewing window. Here, you can see labels for each variable and the first rows of data. 

```{r, eval = F}
View(dhs)
```

Throughout your analysis, you can use the DHS [codebook manual](https://www.dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG4/Recode7_DHS_10Sep2018_DHSG4.pdf) to refer to each variable and its coding structure. You can also use the following code to access the labels for a desired variable. 

```{r}
dhs$v744a[[2]]
```
