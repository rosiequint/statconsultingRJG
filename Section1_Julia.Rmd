## Introduction 

The purpose of this document is to provide step-by-step instructions and code for analyzing the [Demographic and Healthy Surveys Model Data](https://www.dhsprogram.com/data/Download-Model-Datasets.cfm), which can then be extended to analyzing specific country DHS data. DHS data is collected using population-based survey and includes a wide range of variables providing information about population health, reproductive health, child health, and more for countries around the globe. The model dataset is de-identified, re-weighted, and imputed (where missing) data intended to educational purposes. In this example, we use the 'Individual Recode' data file and provide all code in R. 

## Research Objective

Throughout this demo, we explore the research question: **What is the impact of gender norms on health outcomes?** More specifically, we explore outcomes related to domestic violence and contraceptive use, which have direct impact on one's mental, physical, and sexual health. We use predictors related to gender roles and customs in the home, which are further explained in the *Describe Your Data* section. While this research question is one example of how to use DHS data, the methods and code we provided can be extended to other analyses. We present foundational steps for working with different types of variables, plotting data, and modeling relationships, which are important skills for many analyses. We hope this resource will be of use to those interested in answering their own questions using the DHS data.  

This resource is structured as follows.  

## Contents

### 1) Prepare Your Data

Learn how to read in data to your R environment and create a subset according to your analysis. 

### 2) Describe Your Data

Learn how to summarize and visualize your data. Learn how to use sampling weights and stratification to present your summaries. Learn how to create new variables from existing ones.  

### 3) Model Your Data  

Learn how to conduct epidemiologic analyses using linear and logistic regression and hypothesis testing.  


# 1) Prepare Your Data  

Begin by navigating to the [Demographic and Healthy Surveys Model Data](https://www.dhsprogram.com/data/Download-Model-Datasets.cfm) page and downloading the 'Individual Recode' data file shown below (ZZIR62FL.DTA). Save this file to your working directory.

Next, we will need to prepare our R environment. The following packages are required for this analysis. You can install them using the install.packages("package_name") function, and load them using the library() function. 

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(haven)
library(dplyr)
```

Use the following code to read the data into your R environment:  

```{r}
dhs <- read_dta("ZZIR62FL.DTA")
```

Use the View command to open your data into a viewing window. Here, you can see labels for each variable and the first rows of data. 

```{r, eval = F}
View(dhs)
```

Throughout your analysis, you can use the DHS [codebook manual](https://www.dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG4/Recode7_DHS_10Sep2018_DHSG4.pdf) to refer to each variable and its coding structure. You can also use the following code to access the labels for a desired variable. 

```{r}
dhs$v744a[[2]]
```


# 2) Describe Your Data  

First, we will introduce the variables we will use in our analysis.  

#### Outcomes  

**1. Domestic Violence** - variable code D105A-N, D106-D108. These variables account for all instances of physical domestic violence. Here is an example of D105D, "spouse ever kicked or dragged." These are categorical variables. 

```{r}
dhs$d105d[[2]]
table(dhs$d105d)
```

Because these domestic violence variables come from survey questions asked only to women in union/are married (V502), we will restrict our data to the subset of women who are married for the remainder of the analysis: 

```{r}
dhs <- dhs %>%
  filter(v502 == 1)
```

**2. Contraceptive Use** - variable code V312. This categorical variable provides information on contraceptive method.  

```{r}
dhs$v312[[2]]
table(dhs$v312)
```


#### Predictors  

**1. Number of co-wives** - variable code V505. This continuous variable tells how many other wives a woman's husband has. The value of 98 for this variable indicates "don't know." We will remove those with a value of 98 for this variable from our analysis.

```{r}
dhs$v505[[2]]

# remove those with a value of 98 for this variable from our analysis
dhs <- dhs %>%
  filter(v505 != 98)
```

For this continuous variable, we can use the summary command to get a sense of the distribution of this variable in our data.

```{r}
# summarize the variable after removing those with a value of 98
summary(dhs$v505)
```

Here, we see that the mean number of other wives 0.45 and the maximum is 5.  

**2. Contraception decisions** - variable code V822. This categorical variable is about a wife being justified to ask husband to use condom if he has an STI. 

```{r}
dhs$v822[[2]]
table(dhs$v822)
```

Again, we see some responses with a value of 8, which indicates "don't know". We will remove those with a value of 8 for this variable from our analysis.  

```{r}
dhs <- dhs %>%
  filter(v822 != 8)
```

**need to finish 3. and 4. still (julia)

**3. Men endorsing statements that beating is justified** - variable codes (V744A-E)


**4. Man listening** 

# 3) Model Your Data
